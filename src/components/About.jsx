                        Hi, I’m Madilynn Wright from Toronto, currently studying a Combined Major in Science at UBC in Vancouver with a focus on Computer Science, Physics, and Earth and Ocean Sciences. I chose this path because I love exploring the intersections of technology and the natural world. I’m especially interested in projects that combine scientific insight with creative problem-solving—whether it's building tools for data analysis, contributing to meaningful software for nonprofits, or designing user experiences that make knowledge more accessible. I thrive in team environments where curiosity drives innovation and where every project leaves a lasting impact. I’m always eager to grow, collaborate, and create things that matter.
