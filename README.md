# Personal Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio!
This website was built to showcase who I am, what I value, and the work I love doing. It highlights my background, interests, and key projects in a visually engaging and accessible way.

The layout and user interface were designed based on a custom prototype I created in Figma.
- You can view the design prototype here: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/d85V5d0ccSLC2y8qMioe03/Personal-Portfolio?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=xfjpCYZdxHw8wBYM-1)
